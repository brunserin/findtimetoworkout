things to remember for github:

to clone the folder: navigate to where you want to put the folder on your local, do `git clone githuburl.com`

to push files:
**first be sure to do `git pull`**
open the folder in terminal
`git status` will show you what files have been changed
`git add filename` for every file that has been changed that you want to add
`git commit -m "commit message"` after you have added the files you want
`git push origin master` (where it says "master", this is the branch you are pushing to. if you are on a separate branch, you should put the name of that branch there)


branches
`git checkout -b nameofbranch` to create and switch to a new branch 
to add files to this branch use the same process as above for adding files, be sure you are on that branch though and push to that branch
when you're done pushing, go on github website and do 'open pull request' and make a pull request
merge your pull request with master to get your changes from your branch to master

woo!
